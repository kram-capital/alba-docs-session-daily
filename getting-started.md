# Getting Started
!!!
The very first thing you must do, if you haven't already is join our Discord at https://discord.gg/albatherium
!!!
!!!
You will also need the Tradingview charting platform from https://www.tradingview.com/
!!!

### Grab your license

Visit https://albatherium.com/ and grab your copy of OptiStruct. <!-- TODO Learn the process from the team -->
Once you have purchased a license and your invite to OptiStruct has been generated by the team, you will be able to add the indicator to your chart by following the steps outlined below.

### Add Indicator to your chart <!-- TODO change name -->
Simply open Tradingview and access your indicators as you normally would or by pressing the forward slash key '/' on your keyboard. Then navigate to 'invite only Scripts'. From here you can add our indicator to your favourites and also add it to your chart with a single click.

Top Tip: You can save an indicator template in Tradingview by clicking on the four squares next to the indicator button in the header bar. This will allow you to apply your favourite combination of indicators to any layout with a single click. https://shorturl.at/dptvN

### Review the configuration
Once the indicator has been applied to your chart it can be customised to suit your requirements and taste. We will go over the various configuration options in the upcoming sections. To review OptiStruct's configuration simply open the chart legend at the upper left of the panel, below the instrument's label. Here is the Tradingview official documentation for accessing the properties of an indicator [!ref target="blank" text="Official Docs"](https://shorturl.at/isyY6)
