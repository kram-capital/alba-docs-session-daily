The very first thing you must do, if you haven't already is join our Discord at https://discord.gg/albatherium

!!!
You will also need the Tradingview charting platform from https://www.tradingview.com/

### Grab your license

Visit https://albatherium.com/ and grab your copy of Daily & Session Liquidities. 

### Add Daily & Session Liquidities to your chart 
When you have purchased the license, visit our Discord server and create a new ticket containing your payment method, transaction ID and Tradingview user name. Once your invite has been processed, simply open Tradingview and access your indicators as you normally would or by pressing the forward slash key '/' on your keyboard. Then navigate to 'Invite Only Scripts'. From here you can add our indicator to your favourites and also add it to your chart with a single click.

### Review the configuration
Once the indicator has been applied to your chart it can be customised to suit your requirements and taste. We will go over the various configuration options in the upcoming sections. To review Daily & Session Liquidities's configuration simply open the chart legend at the upper left of the panel, below the instrument's label.
