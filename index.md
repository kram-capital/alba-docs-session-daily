# Welcome
**Thank you for choosing the Daily & Sessional Liquidities indicator** 

Daily & Sessional Liquidities is an indicator for the Tradingview charting platform that is designed to automate the setup and maintenance tasks for traders who use the session and daily liquidity concepts of the Trading Hub 3.0 strategy taught by Mr Khan at https://www.youtube.com/@TRADiNGhub

The Trading Hub 3.0 methodology requires advanced knowledge and time from the trader. We have used our expert knowledge of the strategy to create automations in order to free up your time, enabling you to be more productive. Whether you choose to use the time to monitor more instruments with a view to increase your revenue potential or be more productive in other areas of life is entirely up to you! Daily & Sessional Liquidities enables you to set up alerts for the instruments, setups and time frames that you would like to monitor without watching Tradingview. You can set and forget until you receive an alert.

Daily & Sessional Liquidities is part of a suite of indicators that cover the concepts of the strategy. Please check out our other products at https://albatherium.com/
