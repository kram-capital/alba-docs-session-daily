# Configuration

INDICATOR NAME has a plethora of settings enabling you to configure not only the look and feel of the indicator, but also the functionality so that you can tailor your experience to your exact needs. INDICATOR NAME aims to be unopinionated about the way that you trade so that it can be moulded around you and the elements of the strategy that you use. Let's start by opening up the configuration options.
